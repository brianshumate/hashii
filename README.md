## Why?

Casually learning the Go programming language for various values of great good! Please understand that as this is just a personal learning example, it is not open to collaboration and so issues are not enabled on this repository.

## How?

If you have a Go environment, you can download, compile, and run the `hashii` command like this:

```
$ go get -u github.com/brianshumate/hashii
```

Then, have some fun:

```
$ hashii -size=medium -color=random
```

or

```
$ hashii -size=large -color=mix
```

The available colors are standard ANSI foreground colors: _blue_, _cyan_, _green_, _magenta_, _red_, and _yellow_; there are also two special color modes: _mix_ and _random_.
